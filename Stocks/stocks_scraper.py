# 1) Write a program that scrapes the stocks from google 
# 2) Stores/Updates to the db
# 3) From which I can make paginantion and a front end for it
# 4) I would like to maybe write a cron job or maybe use airflow for this
# 5) Later I will try to incoperate a Queue Later on??


# How do I get started?

#  Lets start with scraping 

class Stocks:
    # The stocks are stored in Postgres? 
    # Lets do this on Docker for the time being as I dont want to buy a service.

    def __init__(self):
        
    
    def add_new_stock(self, name, quantity):
        pass

    def remove_stock(self, name, quantity):
        pass
